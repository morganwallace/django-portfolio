###Why I learned Django even though I was a Flask guy
For several years, I've been making web applications primarily in Flask but Django skills are in-demand in the job market so I'm learning it. Flask is a micro-framework written in Python, which is intended to be lightweight meant to be extended by external code where needed; for example, authentication is not included by default but can easily be added.

So I've grown accustomed to starting minimally and then adding extensions only as needed. This worked great, although, it had a steep learning curve. The advantage was that it taught me a bit about how simple servers worked. Even though I love Flask, I have to learn Django to be desirable on the job market. 

### What makes flask and Django different?

Well, for starters. Django starts with more built-in functionality and seems to have more developers working in that framework than flask. Flask is simpler and starts with only the basics. Flask feels like building a computer from scratch and Django is like buying a custom PC; 9 times of out 10, you don't go back and modify any of the core pieces. 

To sum up, **Flask is**:

1. Simple
2. Core is exposed and meant for extension
3. Best for small projects that can grow slowly and intentionally

And to sum up, **Django is**:

1. Fully functioning web application out of the box
2.
